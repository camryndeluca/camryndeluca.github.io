<p id="aboutbio"> As a child, I consumed an abnormal amount of internet and pop culture. Having a sister who was eight years older exposed me to MTV reality television in its heyday and all the greatest hits of the early to mid-2000s.
  Rather than droning on to my loved ones about pertinent moments in pop culture, I've decided to put it to good use. As an arts and entertainment writer for my university's student-run publication The Diamondback, I discuss
  movies, television, music, social media and more. My work page includes my published work and some of my favorite photos I've taken. </p>
